# eap-webpack
### built Oct 2023

My working copy of a basic webpack project all ready to go with HMR. Mot Module Reloading!

HMR doesn't mean Live-Reload!  Live-reload reloads the browser when any file is saved. Those files are HTML, JS, CSS and/or SCSS.

HMR dynamically reloads css or javascript when a CSS, SCSS and/or JS files are saved "without" a browser reload.  Nifty, eh?

This does not include HTML files.

Clone this repository and install with:

```console
npm install
```

To run eap-webpack with HMR:

```console
npm run dev
```
